# Tweet-Analysis-Project-on-COVID-19

Data Science Group Project which seeks to analyze COVID-19 related Tweets for commonly mentioned topics and general population sentiment.

1000 English COVID-19 related Tweets were scraped from Twitter using the Twitter API over a span of 3 days.
Open coding was done to determine one of seven groups that each Tweet belonged to as well as the sentiment associated with each Tweet.

Then, using data science libraries such as NumPy and Pandas along with metrics such as TF-IDF scores, meaningful conclusions on each group and each sentiment were drawn. These conclusions were summarized in a AAAI format report and provide great insight into the general population's understanding/view of the COVID-19 pandemic.
